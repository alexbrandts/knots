# knots

This project investigated properties of knots arising in number theory. Number-theoretic data was collected from an online database, and then algorithms were devised and implemented to convert between several knot encodings, ultimately resulting in the "Dowker-Thistlethwaite" code which allowed the knots to be studied using computational topology software. The output of the topology software was then analyzed to find new connections between number theory and topology. This work was published in 2019 as "Volumes of hyperbolic three-manifolds associated with modular links" in the journal "Symmetry" by A. Brandts, T. Pinsky, L. Silberman.
