# knots

This project investigated properties of knots arising in number theory. Number-theoretic data was collected from an online database, and then algorithms were devised and implemented to convert between several knot encodings, ultimately resulting in the "Dowker-Thistlethwaite" code which allowed the knots to be studied using computational topology software. The output of the topology software was then analyzed to find new connections between number theory and topology.
